# JoshJOkayguy

I'm Josh, I live on the east coast of the USA, and I began learning lua in early January, 2021. I really enjoy programming, it's something that I find fascinating, much like learning a new language. Always looking for new things to do!

Feel free to take a look at any of my repos and comment on them.
